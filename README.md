This repository is based on the works that I am doing for the IIT Jodhpur 2024 in the summers. 
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library):

Purpose: General-purpose computer vision library that includes many tools for image processing, feature detection, and object tracking.
Use in Eye Tracking: Frequently used for preprocessing video frames, detecting pupils and glints, and tracking eye movements.
Features:
Thresholding
Contour detection
Circular Hough Transform
Blob detection
Kalman filter for tracking
Example Projects:
Researchers often combine OpenCV with Python or C++ to develop custom eye-tracking solutions.
Dlib:

Purpose: Machine learning library with tools for real-time face and eye detection.
Use in Eye Tracking: Provides algorithms for detecting facial landmarks, which can be used to locate and track eyes.
Features:
Facial landmark detection
Correlation tracker
Example Projects:
Often used in combination with OpenCV for enhanced tracking capabilities.
PsychoPy:

Purpose: Software for running psychology experiments, including visual stimuli presentation and data collection.
Use in Eye Tracking: Integrates with eye-tracking hardware and software to design and run experiments.
Features:
Integration with various eye trackers
Real-time gaze data collection
Example Projects:
Widely used in psychology and neuroscience research.
EyeTribe Tracker SDK:

Purpose: Software development kit provided by the EyeTribe eye tracker.
Use in Eye Tracking: Offers APIs for accessing eye-tracking data and integrating it into custom applications.
Features:
Real-time gaze data streaming
Calibration routines
Example Projects:
Used in user experience (UX) studies and HCI research.
